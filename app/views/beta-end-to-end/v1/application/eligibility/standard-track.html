        What your medical reports must include
      </h2>

      <p>The first report must provide specific details of your diagnosis of gender dysphoria. It must be provided by a registered medical practitioner or registered psychologist practising in the field of gender dysphoria.</p>

      <p>The second report must include specific details of your treatment, or planned treatment, such as hormone treatments or surgery.</p>

      <p>This report must be made by a registered medical practitioner but they do not need to practise in the field of gender dysphoria.</p>

      <p>This means the report could be completed by your GP or surgeon.</p>
