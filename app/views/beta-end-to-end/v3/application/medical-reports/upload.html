        Upload your medical reports
      </h1>

      <p>You need 2 reports written by 2 different medical doctors or clinical psychologists in the UK.</p>

      <p>The reports both need to include the name, practice address and contact details of the person who wrote the report.</p>

      <p class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">The first report needs to explain the details of your gender dysphoria diagnosis, including:</p>

      <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>who made the diagnosis</li>
        <li>when the diagnosis was made</li>
        <li>any evidence that was used to make the diagnosis</li>
        <li>any medication prescribed and when</li>
        <li>any planned non-surgical treatment, like hormone therapy</li>
        <li>if a referral for surgery was made, and if there was no referral then the reasons why</li>
      </ol>

      <p>This report needs to be written by a registered medical doctor or clinical psychologist who practises in the field of gender dysphoria. You can find one of these by:</p>

      <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>asking your GP for a referral</li>
        <li>contacting someone on the <a href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gender-recognition-certificate-list-of-medical-practitioners-in-the-gender-dysphoria-field">list of specialists in the field of gender dysphoria</a> – this is not a complete list and it is not up-to-date</li>
      </ol>

       <p>The second report needs to explain the details of any treatment you’ve had or plan to have, including:</p>

      <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>whether you’ve had gender reassignment surgery</li>
        <li>each distinct surgical procedure you’ve had and the date it was carried out</li>
        <li>any non-surgical treatment you’ve had in the last 6 months, like hormone therapy</li>
        <li>any future surgical or non-surgical treatment you have planned</li>
        <li>if you have had no treatment and do not plan to have any, the reasons why</li>
      </ol>

      <p>This report can be written by any registered medical doctor or clinical psychologist, including your GP, a surgeon or an endocrinologist.</p>

      <p>It also needs to be as recent as possible. It may not be accepted if it was written over a year before you submit it.</p>

      <p>You’ll probably need to pay for these reports even if you use NHS medical practitioners, so ask in advance how much you’ll be charged.</p>
