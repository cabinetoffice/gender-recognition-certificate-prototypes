      <p class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">This is where you can upload your 2 medical reports. These should be:</p>
      <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>a medical report that explains in full, the specific details of your gender dysphoria diagnosis, written by a registered medical practitioner or registered psychologist practising in the field of gender dysphoria</li>
        <li>a medical report that explains in full, the specific details of your treatment, or planned treatment, such as hormone treatments or surgery, written by a registered medical practitioner â€“ this could be your GP or surgeon</li>
      </ol>

      <p>If you have not had and are not planning any treatment, then the second report should say why not.</p>

      <p>There is a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/937304/t493-eng.pdf">list of specialists in the field of gender dysphoria (opens in new tab)</a>. This is not a complete directory of those in this field and it may not be up to date.</p>
      <p>The medical report does not need to be written by someone on this list, as long as it is written by a medical practitioner or psychologist registered in the field of gender dysphoria.</p>
      <p>Each report should include the name, practice address and contact details of the person writing the report.</p>

      }) }}


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">What the reports should include</h2>

      <p>The first report needs to show your diagnosis of gender dysphoria. It should include details of:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the diagnosis, including when it was made and by who</li>
        <li>any evidence that was used to make the diagnosis </li>
        <li>any medication prescribed and when</li>
        <li>any planned non-surgical treatment</li>
        <li>when a referral for surgery was made and if it hasn&rsquo;t, the reasons why </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The second report needs to show details of your treatment, or planned treatment. It should include details of:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>whether gender reassignment surgery has been carried out</li>
        <li>each distinct surgical procedure and the date it was carried out</li>
        <li>any non-surgical treatment given (such as hormone treatment)</li>
        <li>any further surgical or non-surgical treatment planned </li>
        <li>the reasons why, if there has been no treatment and none is planned</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-8">You are not required to have treatment to get a Gender Recognition Certificate, but if you do not plan to have treatment, this report should say why you don&rsquo;t.</p>
