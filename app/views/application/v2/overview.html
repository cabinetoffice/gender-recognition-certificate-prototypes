        <p>Apply for a Gender Recognition Certificate if you want your affirmed gender to be legally recognised in the UK.</p>

        <p>Although you do not need a Gender Recognition Certificate to get new legal documents like a driving licence or passport, this is not the same as legal recognition.</p>

        <p>Having a Gender Recognition Certificate means you will have the same legal rights as anyone else in that gender. </p>

        <p>It will also let you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>get a new birth certificate which shows your correct gender</li>
          <li>retire and receive state pension at the age appropriate to your gender</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gender-recognition-how-pensions-and-benefits-may-be-affected/gender-recognition-certificate-pensions-and-benefits-note">how a Gender Recognition Certificate could impact any pensions and benefits</a>.</p>




        <h2>Gender Recognition Panel</h2>

        <p>After you apply, your application will be reviewed by a Gender Recognition Panel.</p>

        <p>The panel is made up of people with either legal or medical qualifications. Their responsibility is to make sure applications for a Gender Recognition Certificate meet the requirements in the Gender Recognition Act 2004.</p>

        <p>If your application is not successful, you will be told why and what you can do to resubmit your application.</p>

        <p>Decisions take 12 weeks on average. </p>






        <h2>Fees</h2>

        <p>It costs Â£5 to apply for a Gender Recognition Certificate. If you cannot pay this fee, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-help-with-court-and-tribunal-fees">you can apply for help</a>.</p>

        <p>There may be other costs to consider, such as fees for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>witnessing the signing of a Statutory Declaration</li>
          <li>any certified copies your need of official documents like your birth certificate</li>
          <li>medical professionals to provide your medical reports </li>
          <li>Legal advice or mediation </li>
        </ul>
