        <p>If your birth was registered in the UK the Gender Recognition Panel will give your details to the relevant Registrar General. </p>

        <p>If you are married or in a civil partnership registered in England and Wales or Scotland and you are applying for gender recognition while remaining married or in a civil partnership, then the panel will need to give your details to the appropriate Registrar General. </p>

        <p class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-8">If your application is successful, the Registrar General will contact you about your new birth certificate and a new certificate for your marriage or civil partnership, if relevant.</p>
