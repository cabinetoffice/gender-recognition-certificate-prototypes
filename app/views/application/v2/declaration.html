          <li>are 18 or over</li>
          <li>have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria </li>
          <li>are living in your affirmed gender and have been for at least 2 years</li>
          <li>you intend to live in your affirmed gender for the rest of your life</li>

        <p>If you were born in the UK, the Gender Recognition Panel will tell the relevant General Register Office about your application.</p>

        <p>This will include telling them if you are married or in a civil partnership registered in England and Wales or Scotland and you are applying for gender recognition while remaining married or in a civil partnership.</p>

        <p class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-8">If your application is successful, the General Register Office will contact you about your new birth certificate and, if appropriate, a new certificate for your marriage or civil partnership.</p>
