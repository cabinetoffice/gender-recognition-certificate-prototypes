          Notifying HMRC
        </h1>

        <p>You are required by law to let HMRC know if you have received a Gender Recognition Certificate.</p>

        <p>This is so they can update your tax, tax credit and benefit records.</p>

        <p>If we don&rsquo;t let them know, you will have to send your Gender Recognition Certificate and National Insurance number to them yourself. </p>

        <p>You will have to do this if you pay tax in the Isle of Man or Channel Islands as we can only pass information to UK authorities.</p>

        <p class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-8">Once HMRC has been notified they will write to you at the address they have for you to tell you that your national insurance, tax, tax credits, benefits and pension records have been updated.</p>
