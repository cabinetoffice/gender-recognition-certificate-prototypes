    <p class="govuk-body">You need to upload 2 reports written by 2 different doctors or clinical psychologists registered in the UK.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The reports both need to include the name, practice address and contact details of the person who wrote the report.</p>
    
     <p class="govuk-body">At least one of the two reports needs to include details of any gender affirmation treatment you’ve had or plan to have, including:</p>
    
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-!-margin-bottom-">
      
      <li>any surgical treatments</li>
            <li>any non-surgical treatments, such as hormone therapy</li>
      <li>if you’ve not had any treatment and do not plan to have any, why that’s the case</li> </ul>
    
        <p class="govuk-body">The first report needs to confirm your gender dysphoria diagnosis and the clinical history this was based on, including:</p>

      
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-!-margin-bottom-">
      
      <li>who made the diagnosis</li>
            <li>when the diagnosis was made</li>
      <li>what evidence was used to make the diagnosis</li> </ul>
 
    <p class="govuk-body">This first report needs to be written by a registered doctor or clinical psychologist who practises in the field of gender dysphoria. You can find one of these by:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-!-margin-bottom-">
      
      <li>asking your GP</li>
      <li>contacting someone on the <a href="https://draft-origin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/publications/gender-dysphoria-list-of-specialists-t493">list of specialists in the field of gender dysphoria – this is not a complete list and it’s not always up-to-date</a></li> </ul>
    
    <p class="govuk-body">The second report can be written by any registered doctor or clinical psychologist, including your GP, a surgeon or an endocrinologist.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">There’s no required content for this second report, and it can include the same information from the first report.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">The reports do not need to be specially written for your application, so long as they meet all the requirements. You may already have suitable reports in your medical records.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">If you do need new reports written, you’ll probably need to pay for them even if you use NHS medical practitioners.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">There is a <a href="https://draft-origin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/publications/form-t452-guidelines-for-registered-medical-practitioners-and-registered-psychologists-to-facilitate-completion-of-the-medical-report-proforma-for-g">form that medical practitioners can use to write either of these reports</a>.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Upload copies of evidence to show that you’ve been living in your affirmed gender for the last 2 years.</p>
    
   
<p class="govuk-body">Each piece of evidence should contain at least one of the following that matches up with your affirmed gender:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-!-margin-bottom-">

      <li>a name</li>
<li>a title, like ‘Mr’ or ‘Miss’</li>
      <li>a gender marker, like ‘male’ or ‘female’</li></ul>

<p class="govuk-body">There are no other specific requirements for this evidence, but try to find:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-!-margin-bottom-">

      <li>evidence from different points over the 2 years, with roughly 4 pieces of evidence from each year</li>
<li>at least one piece of recent evidence</li>
      <li>evidence from a variety of different sources</li></ul>

<p class="govuk-body">The evidence can come from before you were diagnosed with gender dysphoria.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Examples of what you can submit include good quality photocopies or photographs of:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-!-margin-bottom-">

      <li>your driving licence</li>
<li>your passport</li>
