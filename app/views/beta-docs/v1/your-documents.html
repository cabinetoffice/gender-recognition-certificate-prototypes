    <p>If you are currently married or in a civil partnership and your spouse or civil partner does not provide a statutory declaration of consent, or you do not plan to stay married or in a civil partnership, then you can still apply for a Gender Recognition Certificate without it, but you will be given an Interim Gender Recognition Certificate. This can be used to end your marriage or civil partnership after which you’ll receive a full certificate.</p>
