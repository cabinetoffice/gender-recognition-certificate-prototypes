        <p>You should collect the documents you need before applying for a Gender Recognition Certificate. </p>

        <p>Some documents, such as medical reports, name change documents and evidence of living in your gender can be uploaded when applying online.</p>

        <p>The rest will need to be posted to us after you submit your application.</p>




        <h2>Documents from all applicants</h2>

        <p>You will need to provide:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>an original or certified <a href="https://www.gov.uk/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate">copy of your full birth certificate</a> (if UK) or official confirmation of date of birth and birth gender (if outside UK)</li>
          <li>a signed Gender Recognition Statutory Declaration either for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-t467-statutory-declaration-for-single-applicants">single people</a>, or for <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/852943/t466-eng.pdf">people married or in a civil partnership</a>, witnessed by someone authorised to administer oaths, such as a solicitor</li>
          <li>copies of all change of name documents if you have changed your name</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You will need to provide these documents even if you&rsquo;ve already received gender recognition in another country or territory.</p>






        <h2>If you have ever been married or been in a civil partnership</h2>

        <p>You also need to provide:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>an original marriage certificate or a certified copy </li>
          <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-t469-statutory-declaration-for-the-spouse-of-an-applicant-for-gender-recognition">spouse or civil partner&rsquo;s signed and witnessed statutory declaration</a>, if you intend to remain married or in a civil partnership after receiving your Gender Recognition Certificate</li>
          <li>a copy of your decree dissolving the marriage or civil partnership, if you do not intend to remain, or are no longer married or in a civil partnership</li>
        </ul>

        <p>However, if your spouse or civil partner has died, you only need to provide:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>an original marriage certificate or a certified copy </li>
          <li>a copy of your spouse or civil partner&rsquo;s death certificate</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If your spouse or civil partner has not died but does not provide a statutory declaration then you can still apply. During the application process you can choose to apply for an interim Gender Recognition Certificate which can be used as grounds to end the relationship. </p>

        <p>You have 6 months to use the interim certificate to end your marriage or civil partnership. You will then be issued with a full certificate.</p>





        <h2>If your gender has been recognised in another country</h2>

        <p>If your gender recognition has been legally accepted in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/overseas-gender-recognition-2011-t491">one of these approved countries or territories</a> you will also need to provide original or certified copies of documents that show this.</p>

        <p>What you need to provide depends on the country where you were recognised. It could include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>your new birth certificate, showing the change of gender</li>
          <li>a court order authorising your change of gender</li>
          <li>a document that&rsquo;s equivalent to a Gender Recognition Certificate in that country</li>
          <li>an entry in a legal register that proves your affirmed gender has been recognised</li>
        </ul>





        <h2>If your gender has not been recognised in another country</h2>


        <h3>Medical reports</h3>

        <p>You will need to upload 2 medical reports as part of your application. </p>
        <ol>
          <li>a medical report that explains in full, the specific details of your gender dysphoria diagnosis, written by a registered medical practitioner or registered psychologist practising in the field of gender dysphoria</li>
          <li>a medical report that explains in full, the specific details of your treatment, or planned treatment, such as hormone treatments or surgery, written by a registered medical practitioner â€“ this could be your GP or surgeon</li>
        </ol>

        <p>There is a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/937304/t493-eng.pdf">list of specialists in the field of gender dysphoria (opens in new tab)</a>. This is not a complete directory of those in this field and it may not be up to date.</p>
        <p>The medical report does not need to be written by someone on this list, as long as it is written by a medical practitioner or psychologist registered in the field of gender dysphoria.</p>
        <p>Each report should include the name, practice address and contact details of the person writing the report.</p>
        {{ govukInsetText({
          html: '<p>There is a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-t452-guidelines-for-registered-medical-practitioners-and-registered-psychologists-to-facilitate-completion-of-the-medical-report-proforma-for-g">form that medical practitioners can use to make these reports</a></p>'
        }) }}


        <h4>What the reports should include</h4>

        <p>The first report needs to show your diagnosis of gender dysphoria. It should include details of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the diagnosis, including when it was made and by who</li>
          <li>any evidence that was used to make the diagnosis </li>
          <li>any medication prescribed and when</li>
          <li>any planned non-surgical treatment</li>
          <li>when a referral for surgery was made and if it hasn&rsquo;t, the reasons why </li>
        </ul>

        <p>The second report needs to show details of your treatment, or planned treatment. It should include details of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>whether gender reassignment surgery has been carried out</li>
          <li>each distinct surgical procedure and the date it was carried out</li>
          <li>any non-surgical treatment given (such as hormone treatment)</li>
          <li>any further surgical or non-surgical treatment planned </li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Evidence of living in your gender for 2 years</h3>

        <p>You also need to upload evidence that you have been living in your affirmed gender. </p>

        <p>You should provide:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>no more than 8 documents from the last 2 years </li>
          <li>try to include documents from dates that are spread throughout those 2 years</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For example, try and provide 4 documents per year and do not include documents that are all dated in the same month.</p>

        <p>Examples of what you could provide:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>driving licence </li>
          <li>passport</li>
          <li>payslips, P60 or P45</li>
          <li>benefits or tax letters and documents</li>
          <li>council tax letters, bank statements, utility bills</li>
          <li>letters from official, professional or business organisations like solicitors, accountants, dentists, doctors and employers</li>
          <li>academic certificates or documentation</li>
          <li>health care or identity cards including photo ID issued by an official organisation </li>
        </ul>


        <h3>If you cannot provide both medical reports</h3>

        <p>If you currently live in England, Wales or Scotland and:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>were married or in a civil partnership in England or Wales on 10 December 2014 or in Scotland on 16 December 2014 </li>
          <li>have been living in your acquired gender for at least 6 years before those dates</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Then you may be able to apply for a Gender Recognition Certificate through an alternate route.</p>

        <p>This means you would not need to supply a medical report detailing a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. However, you would still need to supply a medical report that details any surgery you have had to change your sexual characteristics.</p>

        <p>If you meet these requirements and you would like to apply through this route, then speak to the Gender Recognition Panel&rsquo;s admin team:</p>
